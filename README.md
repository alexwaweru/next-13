# To-Do List Next.js App Documentation
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

This documentation serves as a guide for the To-Do List Next.js app. The app is a simple to-do list application built with Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) applications.

## Getting Started

To run the To-Do List app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd todo-list-nextjs-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Key Features

The To-Do List Next.js app demonstrates several key features of Next.js version 13:

### Next.js 13 Routing

Next.js simplifies routing by automatically generating routes based on the file structure. For example, creating a file named `newTodo.js` inside the `pages` directory will automatically create a route for `/newTodo`. This feature streamlines navigation within the app.

### Server vs Client Components

Next.js allows us to choose whether a component should be rendered on the server or the client side. This flexibility is achieved by using the `getServerSideProps` function for server-side rendering or `useEffect` for client-side rendering. Properly balancing server and client components can lead to better performance and improved user experience.

### Server Component Data Fetching

Next.js provides a straightforward approach to perform server-side data fetching for components. By using `getServerSideProps`, we can fetch data from an external API or database on the server before rendering the page. This ensures that the data is available during the initial render, improving performance and SEO.

### Server Actions

Next.js allows us to handle server-side actions, such as form submissions and complex operations, through API routes and server-side functions. By leveraging server actions, we can ensure the security and reliability of user interactions.

### Server Actions (Buttons)

The app demonstrates handling server-side actions triggered by button clicks. By utilizing server-side functions and API routes, we can perform custom actions on the server when specific buttons are clicked.

## Conclusion

The To-Do List Next.js app showcases essential features of Next.js version 13, including simplified routing, the distinction between server and client components, server component data fetching, and handling server actions triggered by both forms and buttons. This documentation provides insights into the app's structure and how Next.js can be used to build powerful and performant web applications. Happy coding!
